						<h3>The Problem</h3>
					</section>
					<section> 
						I'm an attacker.<p>
						I want to take over accounts on your website.<p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Your site probably looks like this:<p>
						API: <code>www.frowning.wtf/api</code><p>
						Frontend client: <code>www.frowning.wtf</code><p>
						Mobile clients
					</section>
					<section>
						Your sessions probably look like one or more of these:<p>
						<ul>
							<li>JWTs</li>
							<li>Randomized session token</li>
							<li>API tokens</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						As you break your website out from a monolith to microservices, how do you store sessions/tokens between an API and your browser-based frontend client?
					</section>
					<section>
						Auth0's answer:<p>
						<img src="./media/auth0.png">

						Is storing your authentication token in local storage that bad?<p>

						Let's talk about two common attacks
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./media/xss-header.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						What is XSS?<p>
						Cross site scripting
					</section>
					<section>
						Attacker created javascript is executed in the user's browser in the context of site the user visited<p>

						What can you do with XSS?<p>

						What is CSRF?<p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./media/architecture-header.png">
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						First, let's talk about a typical application structure:
						<ul>
							<li><code>www.frowning.wtf</code> - contains your frontend + any monolith code</li>
							<li><code>www.frowning.wtf/api</code> - api</li>
							<li><code>www.frowning.wtf/admin</code> - administrator site</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./media/frankenstein.png"><p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Where is your authentication stored in the browser?
					</section>
					<section>
						Probably in a cookie<p>
						That cookie is probably scoped to <code>*.frowning.wtf</code><p>
						If not, it'll be in local storage, placed there by your javascript<p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Interactions are going through XHR to /api<p>
						<small>For those of you who don't do frontend work:<br>
						XHR is an API called <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.<br>
						It lets you transfer data between a web browser running JS<br>
						and a server without reloading the page.</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						How do you even do CSRF protection to your API?
					</section>
					<section>
						Traditional CSRF protection stores a random token in a form in an HTML page.<p>
						That token gets stored on the server as well.<p>
						When the form is submitted, the token is sent with the form data and validated on the server.
					</section>
					<section>
						Your API may be using a CSRF token, or it may just be relying on monolith form CSRF protection--aka, your api may be vulnerable.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						Improvement: use subdomains
					</section>
					<section>
						Now you have: <p>
							<ul>
								<li><code>api.frowning.wtf</code></li>
								<li><code>www.frowning.wtf</code></li>
								<li><code>admin.frowning.wtf</code></li>
							</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						You can scope cookies to www, admin and api instead of using *.<p>
						The API cookie can have the secure and HTTPonly flags set.<br>
						<small>Secure means that cookie will only be sent over HTTPS</small><br>
						<small>HTTPonly means js can't touch it</small><br>
						<small>Yes, the names are confusing, so remember: for HTTPonly, only HTTP requests can access the cookie.</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						You XHR your requests to api from www.
					</section>
					<section>
						How do you prevent CSRF in your api?
					</section>
					<section>
						Depends on ~content types~<p>
						<ul>
							<li><code>*/*</code></li>
							<li><code>text/plain</code></li>
							<li><code>application/x-www-url-form-encoded</code></li>
							<li><code>application/json</code></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li><code>*/*</code>, can go cross origin</li> 
							<li><code>text/plain</code>, can go cross origin</li>
							<li><code>application/x-www-url-form-encoded</code>, can go cross origin</li>
							<li><code>application/json</code>, can't go cross origin without CORS</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						What is CORS?
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./media/cors.png"><p>
						We care about CORS because of the protection offered by the Same Origin Policy (SOP).
					</section>
					<section>
						What is the Same Origin Policy?<p>
						Lots of requests can't be made from URL1 to URL2 if they differ on the following things:
						<img src="./media/sop.png">
						<ul>
							<li>Protocol (e.g., HTTP vs HTTPS)</li>
							<li>Port</li>
							<li>Host</li>
						</ul><p>
					</section>
					<section>
						CORS must be set on the assets you are accessing.
					</section>					<section>
						How do you reduce the impact of XSS?<p>
						API isn't running js.<p>
						www could still be vulnerable, and site could send requests through XHR.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						Improvement: use iFrames
					</section>
					<section>
						Instead of using CORS, create an iFrame on www to api.<p>
						Use the <code>window.postMessage</code> API<p>
						<small>docs at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage</a></small>
					</section>
					<section>
						<code>window.postMessage()</code> enables cross-origin communication through DOM-based <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget">events.</a><p>
						Windows can send and receive messages from each other through events.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./media/window-postmessage.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<b>ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS validate your origin</b><p>
						<code>if (event.origin !== www.frowning.wtf)<br>
							return;<br>
							// .. otherwise do some stuff
						</code>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						Improvement: use websockets
					</section>
					<section>
						Verify your <code>Origin</code> header.
					</section>
					<section>
						The attacker would need to fake the origin header in the victim's browser.<p>
						Modern browsers don't let you set your own origin header.
					</section>
					<section>
						#fixme
						Common problems:<p>
						Sites don't check auth before upgrading the connection.<p>
						The protocol upgrade request will have access to the browser's cookies. Therefore, check auth when upgrading.<p>
						Set HTTPOnly on the cookies. This will prevent malicious JS on another site from upgrading with authentication.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						Similarities<p>
						iFrames and websockets both have trustworthy origins in the browser.
					</section>
					<section>
						Ultimately, how can you avoid CSRF hitting your API?<p>
						By dropping all requests to API that aren't <code>application/json</code>
					</section>
					<section>
						How can you avoid XSS?<p>
						You can't completely. 
					</section>
					<section>
						How do you know you have a good understanding of all this?<p>
						Tell me why XSS is worse in all these cases.
